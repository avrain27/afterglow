# DEPRECATED
Sadly, the development of afterglow has been pretty stale for some time now. There are currently no plans for further developement regarding this project, so it has to be considered deprecated.

We strongly recommend using [Plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr) instead. If you need a lightbox player, consider [GLightbox](https://github.com/biati-digital/glightbox) which integrates with Plyr.

We want to thank the people at [browserstack](https://browserstack.com) who provide us with a free account for browser testing.

The [afterglow documentation](http://docs.afterglowplayer.com) would not be that cool without [readme.io](http://readme.io), who also sponsor the project with a free account.

Finally, a big thank you to the team behind [jsDelivr](http://jsdelivr.com) for hosting afterglow reliably.
